	/// Computes Adler32 checksum for a stream of data. An Adler32
	/// checksum is not as reliable as a CRC32 checksum, but a lot faster to
	/// compute.
	/// 
	/// The specification for Adler32 may be found in RFC 1950.
	/// ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3)
	/// 
	/// 
	/// From that document:
	/// 
	///      "ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum)
	///       This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data
	///       (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32
	///       algorithm. This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement
	///       of the Fletcher algorithm, used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073
	///       standard.
	/// 
	///       Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is
	///       the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums
	///       are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.  The
	///       Adler-32 checksum is stored as s2*65536 + s1 in most-
	///       significant-byte first (network) order."
	/// 
	///  "8.2. The Adler-32 algorithm
	/// 
	///    The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet
	///    still provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
	/// 
	///    The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552
	///    bytes, so the modulo operation time is negligible.  If the bytes
	///    are a, b, c, the second sum is 3a + 2b + c + 3, and so is position
	///    and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is just a
	///    checksum.  That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible
	///    large class of two-byte errors that leave the check unchanged.
	///    (The Fletcher checksum uses 255, which is not prime and which also
	///    makes the Fletcher check insensitive to single byte changes 0 -
	///    255.)
	/// 
	///    The sum s1 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length
	///    of the sequence part of s2, so that the length does not have to be
	///    checked separately. (Any sequence of zeroes has a Fletcher
	///    checksum of zero.)"
